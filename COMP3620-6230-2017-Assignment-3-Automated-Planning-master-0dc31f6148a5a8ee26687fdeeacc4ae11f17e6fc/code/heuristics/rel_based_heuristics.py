This module contains relaxation heuristics hadm, hFF. You need to implement 
  1) the function calc_goal_h for the hff heuristic.
  2) the __call__(self,node) for the hadm heuristic
calc_goal_h is called within the __call(self,node)__ by the generic call method _RelaxationHeuristic at any step during your search. 
for the hff we have done part of the implementation for a reasonably fast reachability analysis. You need to make use of this analysis to extract your hff estimate
Regarding the hadm heuristic, you can either use the relaxation methods or whatever you come up with for devising your admissible estiamte.
